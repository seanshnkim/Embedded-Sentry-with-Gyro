# Embedded-Sentry-with-Gyro
Embedded Challenge Fall 2024 Term Project: "Embedded Sentry"

### IDE
- PlatformIO
- VSCode

### Mainboard & Microcontroller
- STM32F429I Discovery

### Modules
- mbed
- However, further improvements should be made to replace mbed modules with HAL functions.
- mbed is destined to reach the end-of-life in July 2026

### Main Goal
The project objective is to record and compare certain gestures so as to implement "Lock" and "Unlock" features.
It utilizes Gyroscope MEMS (ST-MEMS I3G4250D) embedded in STM32F429I mainboard.
